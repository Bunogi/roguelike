#Hello, world!
This is a roguelike that I started writing quite recently.

There's nothing much to see yet, but I've gotten the most important things down.

#Building
##You'll need:
	- A compiler with C++11 support
	- SDL2 and SDL2TTF installed
	- CMake
	- Some TTF font for the graphics

##Steps: 
```
mkdir build && cd build;
cmake ..  && make;
```
